# Python Machine Learning Project

This is a Python machine learning project workspace with essential tools and libraries for data science and ML development.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Main source code
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
- `data/` - Data files (raw and processed)
- `models/` - Trained model files
- `tests/` - Unit tests
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `setup.py` - Package setup configuration

## Development Guidelines
- Use virtual environments for dependency management
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Write comprehensive docstrings for functions and classes
- Include unit tests for core functionality
- Use type hints where appropriate

## Key Libraries
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: Numerical computing
- scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms
- matplotlib/seaborn: Data visualization
- jupyter: Interactive notebooks
